This app recursively searches for files and folders in a directory. So be careful when giving it directory with lots of files and folders.


Setup
---
 
```
Install node.
```



Usage
---

In the directory containing main.js run the following command where directory-path must be absolute:
 
```
node main <directory-path>
```
